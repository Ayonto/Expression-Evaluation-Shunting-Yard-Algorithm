# Expression Evaluation - Shunting Yard Algorithm

Binary Expression evaluator, implemented using [**Shunting Yard Algorithm**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting_yard_algorithm#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20the%20shunting,abstract%20syntax%20tree%20(AST).)
in C++

## Features
The current implementation supports the following binary operators:
* Addition `+`
* Subtraction `-`
* Multiplication `*`

Implementation inspiration: Learned about Shunting Yard Algorithm from [cmaureir](https://github.com/cmaureir/ast)
